# sign-up-form
Front-end only browser sign-up form

Prototype with Figma and created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From this project, I learned how to:
- Implement a form and its elements with form validation
- Use advanced selectors and combinators
- Apply positioning techniques
- Create SVGs and implement them into a browser
- Experiment with CSS resets and different CSS units (absolute vs relative)
- Work with custom properties and CSS functions
